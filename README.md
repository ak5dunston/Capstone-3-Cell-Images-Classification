# Capstone-3-Cell-Images-Classification
Infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue are caused by parasites like viruses. After infection, the patient's cells start spreading these parasites all over the body. Once the body cells are infected with parasites, that is called ‘parasitized’ or ‘infected’ cells. Other hand, the cells that are not infected with parasites are called ‘uninfected’. So, it is crucial to detect these infected (parasitized) cells before they cause serious illness to patients. We can identify these infected cells using their images which are stained with chemical dyes. Generally, two types of dyes are used to identify the ‘infected’ and ‘uninfected’ cells: 1. eosin (pink) and 2. hematoxylin (blue). Simply to understand, the images which contain the blue stains are infected with parasites, whereas cell images containing only pink are classified as uninfected cells. Here, we aim to classify the infected and uninfected images by training more than 10000 images that will help in predicting the right class upon testing.
